# IPL Cricket Score Predictor

# Project Description
- This is a Flask web application that predicts the score a cricket team is likely to score in the first innings of a match based on certain input parameters. 
- The model used in this application is a Linear Regression model which was trained on a dataset of IPL matches.

# Packages Required
- Flask
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn


# How to Install Required Packages
You can install the required packages using pip or conda. 
Here are the commands to install the required packages using pip:
- pip install Flask 
- pip install numpy 
- pip install pandas 
- pip install scikit-learn


# How to Run the Application

- Clone the repository or download the code files.
- Navigate to the project directory in the command prompt.
- Run the following command to start the Flask server:python app.py

Open a web browser and go to https://github.com/shahvivek2004/cricketscorepredictor to access the web application.
Note: Make sure that you have installed all the required packages before running the application.

# Algorithm
- The algorithm used in this program includes the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting data from various sources such as historical IPL match data, player statistics, and current team composition.

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, preprocessing, and formatting the collected data into a suitable format for analysis.

- Feature Extraction: Identifying the relevant features that can affect the score of an IPL match, such as team composition, batting and bowling performance of individual players, venue, weather conditions, and toss winner.

- Model Selection: Selecting a suitable machine learning model based on the type of data and the nature of the problem, such as a regression model.

- Model Training: Training the selected machine learning model using the preprocessed data by dividing the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model on the training set, and evaluating the performance on the testing set.

- Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the score of an IPL match based on the relevant features.
